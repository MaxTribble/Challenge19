# JATE Note Pad

## Description

For this project, I made a downloadable note taker. I wanted a note taker that I can call at the click of a button. I decided to deploy it when I figured other people would like it as well. I think this is going to be a very useful tool for housing notes.

## Installation and Usage

The application is run in the browser and saves your notes locally to access them at a later time. This application has a unique feature to download if you want. the installation of this application is very simple, just click the install button in the top heading to download the application.

## Credits

I would like to credit the DU Bootcamp for helping me complete this task. I used class examples to work through this application and get it working.
